Over the last few years, the Board has been responsible for bringing popular student destinations to the USU including the Student Recreation Center, Oasis Wellness Center, DREAM Center, Veterans Resource Center, Pride Center and the future “New Heart of Campus” — a construction and renovation project created by students and for students that will be transformative for the CSUN campus. Each year, Board members bring you popular USU events like Matador Nights, Carnaval, Crunch Time, and have organized a number of virtual programs and events throughout the pandemic to keep you connected to your CSUN community. That’s why it’s so important for you to vote in the USU Board of Directors and Associated Students Elections this spring — because the student leaders you elect will get things done for you.
