All fitness levels are welcome. 10 – 11 a.m. Living Your Sacred Purpose w Dakota Earth Cloud Walker For many, the idea of sacred purpose is about what you do for a living - the job or career you choose. While that is an important aspect of your sacred purpose, the true meaning of why you are here runs far deeper. It's about the relationships you build in your life, the space you occupy, the spiritual truths you hold, and the contribution you make to the world through your work. When these four areas of Sacred Purpose are congruent, you are truly living into your soul's calling. If any one of these areas is out of balance, or neglected, then your life path will feel incomplete. In this workshop, Dakota will share the four main tenets of your Sacred Purpose using the ancient Medicine Wheel as a container for understanding their relationship to one another. You will explore the health of your 'medicine wheel' and steps you can actively take to begin embodying and living into your Sacred Purpose fully. 12 – 12:20 p.m. Pranayama w Deepa Pranayama focuses on breathing techniques, which are done laying down and or seated.

It gives us a lens to reflect upon what we currently have, what we need to let go, and what we can do to bring more balance to our lives. In this workshop, Dakota will lead you on a soul inquiry to determine what your current 'medicine wheel' is comprised of and what your soul wishes to manifest.
